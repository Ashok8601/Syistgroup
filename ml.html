    <div class="faq">
      <h3>1. What is Machine Learning?</h3>
      <p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>2. What are the types of ML?</h3>
      <p>Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>3. What is supervised learning?</h3>
      <p>In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, where the input and expected output are known.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>4. What is overfitting?</h3>
      <p>Overfitting occurs when the model learns noise and details in training data, reducing its performance on unseen data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>5. What is a confusion matrix?</h3>
      <p>A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted and actual results.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>9. What is cross-validation?</h3>
      <p>A method to assess how a model will perform on unseen data by dividing the dataset into training and validation sets multiple times.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>10. What is a neural network?</h3>
      <p>A computational model inspired by the human brain, used especially in deep learning for recognizing patterns.</p>
