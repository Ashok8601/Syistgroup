        <h2><span class="tip-number">1.</span> <span class="tip-title">ü•¶ Healthy Eating Tip 1: Base Your Meals on Higher Fibre Starchy Carbohydrates</span></h2>
        <p>Higher fibre starchy carbohydrates should form just over one-third of your everyday meals. Foods like potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, and cereals fall into this category.

Go for wholegrain or higher fibre versions such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice, or potatoes with skin ‚Äî they contain more fibre compared to refined or white starches and help you stay fuller for longer, aiding in weight management.
<img src="t1.jpg" alt="5 A Day Fruits and Vegetables Variety Plate" title="Eat 5 Portions of Fruits and Vegetables Daily" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; height:auto; border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom:20px;">
Include at least one starchy food in each main meal. Despite the myth, starchy foods are not inherently fattening. In fact, gram for gram, they deliver less than half the calories of fat.

However, be mindful of how you cook and serve them. Adding oil to chips, butter on toast, or creamy sauces to pasta can significantly raise the calorie count.

        <h2><span class="tip-number">2.</span> <span class="tip-title">üçé Healthy Eating Tip 2: Eat Lots of Fruit and Veg</span></h2>
      <p>Health experts advise consuming at least 5 portions of fruit and veg each day. These can be fresh, frozen, dried, canned, or even juiced.</p>

<p>Achieving your 5 A Day isn‚Äôt difficult ‚Äî try slicing a banana over your breakfast cereal, or replacing a processed snack with an apple or orange.</p>
<img src="t2.jpg" alt="Free Sugars in Processed Foods and Drinks" title="Avoid Free Sugars in Packaged Foods" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; height:auto; border-radius:10px; box-shadow:0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom:20px;">

<p>A standard portion size is:</p>

<p>
    <strong>80g</strong> of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit or vegetables<br />
    <strong>30g</strong> for dried fruit (best eaten during meals)<br />
    <strong>150ml</strong> of fruit juice, smoothie, or vegetable juice (limit to 1 glass daily due to high natural sugar content, which may harm your teeth)
</p>

<p>Adding a variety of colourful fruits and vegetables to your diet supports better digestion, immunity, and overall wellness.</p>

        <h2><span class="tip-number">3.</span> <span class="tip-title">üç¨ Healthy Eating Tip 3: Cut Down on Sugary Foods and Drinks</span></h2>
       <p>Sugary foods and drinks are often packed with energy, either in the form of kilojoules or calories, and regular consumption can lead to weight gain over time. Additionally, frequent sugar intake ‚Äî especially between meals ‚Äî can contribute to tooth decay and poor dental health.</p>

<p>The sugars you need to reduce are called <strong>free sugars</strong>. These are sugars added to food and drink during processing, or those found naturally in substances like honey, syrups, unsweetened fruit juices, and smoothies.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt include the natural sugars found in whole fruits or milk ‚Äî those are fine as part of a healthy diet.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, many packaged foods and drinks include high levels of free sugars. Examples include:</p>

<p>
    &#x2022; Sugary fizzy drinks<br />
    &#x2022; Sugary breakfast cereals<br />
    &#x2022; Cakes and biscuits<br />
    &#x2022; Pastries and puddings<br />
    &#x2022; Sweets, chocolate, and even alcoholic drinks
</p>

<p>To make better choices, always read food labels.</p>

<p>
    <strong>High in sugar:</strong> More than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g<br />
    <strong>Low in sugar:</strong> 5g or less per 100g
</p>

<p>By staying aware of your sugar intake, checking labels, and choosing low sugar foods, you can support better nutrition, energy balance, and long-term health goals.</p>

        <h2><span class="tip-number">4.</span> <span class="tip-title">üç© Healthy Eating Tip 4: Cut Down on Saturated Fat and Sugar</span></h2>
<p>üßà <strong>Saturated Fat</strong></p>

<p>Our body needs some fat for energy and absorption of certain nutrients, but both the type and quantity of fat matter.</p>

<p>There are 2 main types:</p>
<p>
    &#x2022; Saturated fat<br />
    &#x2022; Unsaturated fat
</p>

<p>Too much saturated fat can raise cholesterol levels in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended limits:</strong></p>
<p>
    &#x25AA; Men: No more than <strong>30g</strong> per day<br />
    &#x25AA; Women: Limit to <strong>20g</strong> per day<br />
    &#x25AA; Children under 11: Less than adults<br />
    &#x25AA; Children under 5: Low-fat diet is <strong>not suitable</strong>. Full-fat dairy (like cheese, fromage frais, and yoghurt) is encouraged up to age 2.
</p>

<p><strong>Common sources of saturated fat include:</strong></p>
<p>
    &#x2022; Fatty cuts of meat<br />
    &#x2022; Sausages<br />
    &#x2022; Butter and hard cheese<br />
    &#x2022; Cream<br />
    &#x2022; Cakes and biscuits<br />
    &#x2022; Lard and pies
</p>

<p><strong>To reduce your intake, switch to unsaturated fats such as:</strong></p>
<p>
    &#x2022; Vegetable oils<br />
    &#x2022; Olive oil<br />
    &#x2022; Oily fish<br />
    &#x2022; Avocados
</p>

<p>Choose lean cuts of meat, trim visible fat, and use reduced-fat spreads instead of butter, lard, or ghee.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> All fats are high in energy, so even healthy fats should be eaten in moderation.</p>

        <h2><span class="tip-number">5.</span> <span class="tip-title">üßÇ Healthy Eating Tip 5: Eat Less Salt ‚Äì No More Than 6g a Day for Adults</span></h2>
<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Salt and Your Health</strong></p>

<p>Consuming too much salt can lead to higher blood pressure, which increases your chances of developing heart disease or suffering a stroke.</p>

<p>Even if you don‚Äôt add salt during cooking or at the table, you might still be eating too much. Around <strong>three-quarters</strong> of the salt we consume is already present in processed or packaged foods like:</p>

<p>
    &#x2022; Breakfast cereals<br />
    &#x2022; Soups<br />
    &#x2022; Breads<br />
    &#x2022; Ready-made sauces
</p>

<p>To manage your sodium intake, always check food labels.</p>

<p>
    <strong>High in salt:</strong> More than <strong>1.5g of salt per 100g</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Daily limit:</strong><br />
    &#x25AA; Adults and children 11+: Max <strong>6g/day</strong> (about 1 teaspoon)<br />
    &#x25AA; Younger children: Even less is recommended
</p>

<p>By choosing low salt options and reducing intake from processed foods, you can support a healthy heart and reduce the risk of hypertension.</p>

       <p><strong>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Physical Activity and Healthy Weight</strong></p>

<p>Along with maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity plays a key role in improving your wellbeing and lowering the risk of serious health problems.</p>

<p>Staying active can help prevent or manage conditions like:</p>

<p>
    &#x2022; Type 2 diabetes<br />
    &#x2022; Certain cancers<br />
    &#x2022; Heart disease<br />
    &#x2022; Stroke
</p>

<p>Being overweight or obese increases the risk of these illnesses. On the other hand, being underweight may also negatively impact your health.</p>

<p><strong>Most adults who are overweight</strong> need to lose weight by:</p>
<p>
    &#x25AA; Consuming fewer calories<br />
    &#x25AA; Increasing physical activity
</p>

<p>A good approach includes:</p>
<p>
    &#x2022; Eating a balanced diet<br />
    &#x2022; Following a consistent fitness routine<br />
    &#x2022; Limiting calorie intake
</p>

<p>To check if you're at a healthy weight, use a <strong>BMI (Body Mass Index)</strong> calculator ‚Äî it helps determine whether your weight is appropriate for your height.</p>

<p>If you're aiming to lose fat safely, consider structured programs like the <strong>12-week NHS weight loss plan</strong>, which offers expert advice on nutrition and physical activity.</p>

<p>If you're underweight, consult trusted resources or speak with a <strong>dietitian or GP</strong> for personalized guidance.</p>

<p>To prevent dehydration, it‚Äôs important to drink enough fluids throughout the day. The government recommends consuming about <strong>6 to 8 glasses daily</strong>, in addition to the moisture you get from your food.</p>

<p>All non-alcoholic drinks count toward your fluid intake, but the healthiest options include:</p>

    &#x2022; Lower fat milk<br />
    &#x2022; Lower sugar drinks such as tea and coffee
</p>

<p>It‚Äôs best to avoid sugary soft drinks and fizzy beverages because they are high in calories and can harm your teeth.</p>

<p>Even unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies contain a high amount of free sugars. Limit your combined intake of these to <strong>no more than 150ml per day</strong> (a small glass).</p>
